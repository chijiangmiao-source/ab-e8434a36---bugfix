"""Endmember audit solver.

Finds a minimum-support non-negative exact rational convex combination of
endmembers that reproduces a target tracer vector, breaking ties by total
review cost and then by the lexicographically smallest id sequence.  Each
endmember is also classified by how often it participates in the
cost-tied optimal solutions (always / partial / never).

All arithmetic is exact: tracers are integers, targets are rationals with
up to four decimal places, and weights are :class:`fractions.Fraction`.

Geometry fact: with three tracers the points live in R^3, so by
Caratheodory a convex combination, when one exists, uses at most four
endmembers.  Every minimum-support combination uses affinely independent
points (dependent positive weights could be perturbed until one weight
vanishes), hence each endmember subset determines at most one weight
vector and the set of minimum-support solutions is finite.
